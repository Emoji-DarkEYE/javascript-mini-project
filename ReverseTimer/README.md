## How to Build the Countdown Timer

In this section, I will guide you step by step on how to create the Countdown Timer. Follow these instructions carefully, and you'll have your timer ready in no time!

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

1. **Create a New Folder**:
   - Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store your project. You can name it `CountdownTimer`.

2. **Open the Folder**:
   - Open the folder in your preferred code editor (like VSCode, Atom, etc.).

### Step 2: Creating HTML File

1. **Create an HTML File**:
   - Inside the `CountdownTimer` folder, create a new file and name it `index.html`.

2. **Add Basic HTML Structure**:
   - Write the basic HTML structure in `index.html`. This includes the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

3. **Include Bootstrap**:
   - In the `<head>` section, include a link to Bootstrap CSS to style your page. You can use the following link:
     ```html
     <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
     ```

4. **Create a Container**:
   - Inside the `<body>`, create a `div` with the class `container` to hold your form and countdown timer.

### Step 3: Building the Form

1. **Add Event Form**:
   - Inside the container, create a form that includes:
     - A text input for the event name.
     - A datetime input for the event date and time.
     - A button to start the timer.

2. **Hide the Countdown Initially**:
   - Below the form, create another `div` for the countdown timer. Initially, this should be hidden. Use the `hidden` class to achieve this.

### Step 4: Adding Countdown Display

1. **Create Countdown Elements**:
   - Inside the countdown `div`, create spans for days, hours, minutes, and seconds, along with small labels (D, H, M, S) for each.

### Step 5: Adding JavaScript Functionality

1. **Create a JavaScript File**:
   - Create a new file in the same folder and name it `script.js`.

2. **Link JavaScript to HTML**:
   - At the end of the `body` tag in `index.html`, link to the `script.js` file:
     ```html
     <script src="script.js"></script>
     ```

3. **Write JavaScript Logic**:
   - Inside `script.js`, write the code to:
     - Select the form and countdown elements.
     - Add an event listener to the start button to:
       - Get the event name and date.
       - Start the countdown when the button is clicked.
     - Create a function to update the countdown every second.

### Step 6: Styling with CSS

1. **Create a CSS File**:
   - Create a new file and name it `styles.css`.

2. **Add Custom Styles**:
   - Inside `styles.css`, write styles to:
     - Set a dark background and white text.
     - Style the countdown display with flexbox for alignment.

### Step 7: Testing Your Timer

1. **Open the HTML File**:
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.

2. **Enter Event Details**:
   - Fill in the event name and date/time, then click the "Start Timer" button.

3. **Check the Countdown**:
   - Ensure the countdown works and updates correctly. Test with different dates and times.
